      I'm really sorry... 💔

      I know I messed up, and I hate knowing that I hurt you. You mean the world to me and every second you're upset is a second too long...

      I miss your smile, your laughter, your warmth. Please forgive me. Let's talk it through, and I promise to do better, every single day.

      Love always,  
      [Your Name]
