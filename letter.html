      I'm really sorry... 💔

      I know I messed up,(barbar ekta kaaj korsi) and I hate knowing that I hurt you. You mean the world to me and every second you're upset is a second too long...I love you Nursat, you are my only one💗

       Please forgive  and I promise to do better, every single day.

      Love always,  
      [Rafid]
